Such behavior \\nis unacceptable and may be grounds for immediate termination from the Adoption Program. This \\napplies to all individuals working or volunteering on behalf of Adoption Partner organizations at \\nin-store Adoption Events and occupying 7-Day Cat Centers and/or Everyday Adoption Centers \\n(EACs), as well as any interactions with the public, customers, or other partner organizations.\\n \\nWe are committed to providing a work and service environment that is safe, inclusive, and \\nwelcoming for everyone. Harassment can take many forms, including but not limited to, verbal \\ncomments, inappropriate jokes, gestures, unwelcome advances, or any behavior that creates a hostile \\nor uncomfortable atmosphere. Discrimination can occur through biased treatment, exclusion, or \\nunequal access to opportunities based on personal characteristics or affiliations. \\nEvery person involved with in-store adoptions is expected to actively contribute to a culture of \\nrespect and support. It is crucial that all personnel treat colleagues, volunteers, customers, and \\ncommunity members with the utmost respect and dignity. Creating a positive and supportive \\nenvironment is not only essential for maintaining a productive workplace, but also ensures that we \\ncan focus on our shared mission of saving animals' lives and serving the community. \\nIf any staff member, volunteer, or customer experiences or witnesses harassment or discrimination, \\nthey are strongly encouraged to report it immediately to their supervisor, the Store Leader, or their \\nPetSmart Charities Adoption Grants Manager. Reports will be taken seriously and will be handled \\nwith confidentiality, professionalism, and appropriate follow-up action. \\nEnsuring a respectful, harassment-free, and discrimination-free environment is critical to the \\nsuccess of the PetSmart Charities Adoption Program, and we rely on every participant to uphold \\nthese standards. \\n\",\n",

Knowingly handling or maintaining pets in any condition that is counter to \\nthe standards and policies outlined in this manual is grounds for immediate dismissal from the In-\\nStore Adoption Program. Adoption Partners are fully responsible for all actions and omissions of \\ntheir employees, contractors, agents, representatives, and volunteers at all times. \\nDENYING AN ADOPTION: EDUCATE, INFORM, PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES\\nParamount to a successful adoption is educating potential pet parents on the adoption process, \\nincluding but not limited to, informing them of the responsibilities that come with adopting a pet \\nwhile discussing the profiles of individual pets. If adoption is not in the best interest of the pet or the \\npet parent, provide alternatives.\\nIn the event you must deny an adoption, be sensitive to the pet parent’s needs. They may be \\ngreatly disappointed. How you communicate will create an educated and understanding supporter \\nor a confused and potentially difficult adversary. Many people will perceive an adoption denial as a \\njudgment about their abilities as pet parents.\\nMost of the time it is not the message, rather, how the message is delivered that causes a potential \\nadopter to become upset. Denying an adoption is a delicate situation, and poor communication can \\ncreate misunderstanding. Using tact and diplomacy and offering alternatives to a denied adopter is \\ncritically important. All personnel must take these steps when an adoption is denied:\\n\\t•\\nTactfully provide a professional explanation; just saying “no” is never enough. Where appropriate, \\nconsider offering alternative pets up for adoption that might be a better fit.\\n\\t•\\nUse discretion during any denial; enlist support from the PetSmart Store Leader if needed. \\n\\t•\\nDo everything in your power to ensure that no pet parent leaves unreasonably confused or \\nupset.\\nAlways thank pet parents for considering an adoption. Regardless of whether a visit results in an \\nadoption, thank every customer for stopping by. Remember, they are members of your community \\nand could possibly be future volunteers, donors, or advocates for your organization.\\n',\n",

       "  {'text': '25\\nPetSmart Charities\\nADOPTION PARTNER MANUAL - US/PR    I    2025-26\\nPET DEATH\\nIt is recommended, but not mandatory, that a necropsy be performed any time there is an unexplained \\ndeath, because other pets could be at potential risk for disease. Necropsy may be unneeded if a pet had been \\ndiagnosed with a pre-existing condition or if the death is from identifiable trauma. The cost of the necropsy is \\nthe responsibility of the Adoption Partner.\\nNeither PetSmart nor PetSmart Charities assume any responsibility for the death of an Adoption Partner pet.\\nExpectations with regard to the handling of a pet death are outlined in more detail below.\\nESCAPED PET\\nFacilitating adoptions in designated adoption areas takes focused supervision. Should an escape occur, follow \\nthe necessary steps to resolve the issue.\\nIf the escaped pet is still inside the store, alert the PetSmart Store Leader immediately so PetSmart \\nAssociates can be posted at doors and automatic doors can be turned off until the pet is recovered. An \\nannouncement over the PA system or the use of a two-way radio, if available, may be required to get all \\ndoors covered immediately.\\nIf the pet has left the store, more extensive measures are required. The Adoption Partner must assign search \\nparty leaders and establish a command post to manage communication. Search party leaders must:\\n\\t•\\nCreate a list of individuals to participate in an exterior search party and provide the list to the command post\\n\\t•\\nCall the command post every 30 minutes, even if no contact with the pet has been made; and  \\n\\t•\\nReport areas the search party has covered and receive input from other search parties\\nIf the search continues beyond the first few hours, contact should be made regularly throughout the search \\nwith entities listed below. These organizations or people affiliated with them may have contact with the pet at \\nsome point.\\n\\t•\\nLocal animal control or humane organizations in the area \\n\\t•\\nAll PetSmart store Associates\\n\\t•\\nPersonnel in adjacent businesses; local food delivery contacts\\nIf the pet is not recovered within 24 hours, it is recommended that the Adoption Partners create posters \\nand flyers with the pet’s picture to be printed and displayed. The Adoption Partner will determine whether \\nposters, flyers, and ads should be made; materials can be posted at the PetSmart store upon approval from \\nthe PetSmart Store Leader.  \\nThe Adoption Partner must make plans for emergency care for the pet upon recovery. Once the pet is \\nrecovered, the Adoption Partner will ensure any veterinary requirements are met. To prevent undue stress \\nand transmission of communicable diseases, and regardless of health status, the pet must not be placed for \\nadoption in PetSmart for at least 72 hours after recovery.\\n',\n",
